In this assignment we perform an analysis of the text of Airbnb property listings. In particular, our objective is to create an appropriate Search Engine to find the perfect house depending on the user's request.


## Data to analyze
For the analysis, we used the data of the [Airbnb Property Data from Texas](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/airbnb-property-data-from-texas), which contains the informations of 18259 accomodations available in Texas.
